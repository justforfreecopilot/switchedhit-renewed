# 🏏 Cricket Squad & Lineup Management Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete cricket team management system with 15-player squads, batting order management, and bowling order allocation, replacing the previous football-style formation display.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **15-Player Cricket Squad Generation**
- **Updated Player.php**: Modified `generateTeamPlayers()` to create 15 players instead of 11
- **Enhanced Squad Composition**:
  - 2 Wicket-keepers (backup keeper option)
  - 3 Opening batsmen (format flexibility)
  - 4 Middle-order batsmen (core batting lineup)
  - 2 Finishers (death overs specialists)
  - 2 All-rounders (team balance)
  - 3 Fast bowlers (pace attack)
  - 2 Spin bowlers (spin options)

### 2. **Batting Order Management Interface**
- **Drag-and-drop functionality** for 11-player batting lineup
- **Visual squad pool** showing all 15 available players
- **Position-specific hints** (opener, #3 batsman, finisher, etc.)
- **Player statistics display** (batting average, overall rating)
- **Auto-set feature** based on batting averages
- **Save/load functionality** with database persistence

### 3. **Bowling Order Management System**
- **20-over grid layout** for T20 format
- **Cricket bowling rules enforcement**:
  - Maximum 4 overs per bowler
  - No consecutive overs for same bowler
  - Visual validation and error messages
- **Bowler pool filtering** (Fast-bowlers, Spin-bowlers, All-rounders)
- **Auto-allocation algorithm** respecting cricket rules
- **Real-time visual feedback** for valid/invalid assignments

### 4. **Database Schema Updates**
- **Added columns to teams table**:
  - `batting_order` (JSON) - stores 11-player batting lineup
  - `bowling_order` (JSON) - stores 20-over bowling allocation
- **Automatic migration script** for existing databases

### 5. **API Endpoints for Lineup Management**
- `GET /api/team/batting-order` - Retrieve saved batting order
- `POST /api/team/batting-order` - Save batting order with validation
- `GET /api/team/bowling-order` - Retrieve saved bowling order  
- `POST /api/team/bowling-order` - Save bowling order with cricket rules validation

## 🎨 User Interface Changes

### **Before (Football Formation)**
- Static football pitch display
- 11-player formation layout
- Position-based field placement
- Football terminology throughout

### **After (Cricket Lineup Management)**
- **Batting Order Section**:
  - Squad pool (15 players available)
